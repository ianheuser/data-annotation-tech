 Tests for AI Prompt Training
## Data Annotation Technologies

### 1. This is a home for my work for Data Annotation Tech, teaching AI models to code.
### 2. I will be using this repot as a test workflow as I record the AI model outputs against one another to see how they compare. To better allow it to understand how to help us code. Kind of funny.... Especially as AI helps me write this....
### 3. My initial idea is just to create a folder every day, labeled with the date I work, and then the files and code or whatever it may be from the day will be inside....

### 4. I will be using my expertise in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS for the most part, but I will also be using languages I don't know quite as wel, like Python, to see how the AI model can help me learn, as I TEACH IT!! Mindblowing.
